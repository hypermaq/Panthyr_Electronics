Communications PCB
************************
v0.1 -> v0.2
- C1: value changed to 1uF (to assure ESD performance, see datasheet MAX13433EESD+)
- J3: Silkscreen changed (swapped Tx+ and Tx- to correct mistake), added signal direction arrows
- J3: added a SHIELD connection, through ferrite and 100R to GND
- F1: changed to 500mA version, has lower Rtyp
- Via style changed to 0.04/0.06"
- Added resistors to TTYO1 and TTYO2 (leakage to ground through serial lines)
- Footprint test points
- Thermals on ground pour: 4 spokes
- Added option to use ttyO5 as RS232

************************
Power PCB
************************
v0.1 -> v0.2
- F1: Value changed from 750mA to 1.1A
- Footprints LED's: smaller
- Footprints MOSFET: silkscreen larger
- Resistors LED's: Value set to 5k6 (visible at 12V in direct light)
- Via style changed to 0.04/0.06"
- Added power button
- Added reset button
- Footprint test points smaller
- Thermals on ground pour: 4 spokes
- Added J17: GPIO
- Changed silkscreen: "Outputs are high side switched" should be "... low side..."
- 100R gate resistors on all FETs
- Corrected footprints for PTCs. 2920 and 1812 series have different sizes

************************
Power PCB
************************
v0.2 -> v0.3
- F2-7: 1.1 1812 fuses instead of 2920 (lower resistance)
- Mosfets replaced with TC4427_UA MOSFET drivers
- Silkscreen updated
- Added power and reset buttons 
- Lots of static GND vias
- P9_14 is GPIO 50 instead of GPIO 40
- Added Opamp circuits to measure VBat (<26Vdc)

v0.3 -> v0.4
- Potmeter/resistor divider for Vbat in to opamp
- Output 5 driven by pin P8_39 instead of P8_43. Pulling P8_43 (or P8_41) low makes the BBB not boot
- Corrected Opamp U1/U2 footprint and routing
- Different FET drivers, and separate FETS.
- HIGH SIDE SWITCHING!

v0.4 -> v0.5
- Batt in did not work for floating power supplies (GND batt != GND electronics)
- Replaced by INA168NA/3K high side current sense
- Added Batt neg terminal
- Battery terminals are fused
- footprint opamps was not correct
- Using TPS26601RHFT eFuse to power outputs and limit current
- 

v0.5 -> v0.6
- Added correct resistor values for OVP/UVP on TPS
- Added correct resistor value for R17 (voltage gain of INA168NA/3K)
- Enlarged floating ground planes under TPS where possible
- Changed LED current limiting resistors to higher value (was too bright at 12/24V)
- 


************************
Topside PCB
************************
v0.1 -> v0.2
- Larger silkscreen for LED's (polarity seems inverted when small silk is printed)
- Input voltage range added
- input cap (C18) changed from 35V to 50V
- U4 (LM2937IMP-10/NOPB LDO) replaced by 2383012 (SOT263 footprint)
- Added Hypermaq logo
- C12/C13 replaced with correct values (10pF instead of 10uF)
- Added UART4
- Removed useless test points
- Added switch to select top or bottom

v0.2 -> v0.3
- U4 (LDO for Ramses) replaced with BD90c0AFPS-E2, c26 and c27 replaced with 2.2uF 50V 0805 caps
- Clean up some silkscreens
- component silkscreen for orange 180deg connector now shows orientation
- TODO: change hole dim for camera (updated iam)

v0.1 -> v0.2
- Mounting hole dimensions to 3.5mm ID to compensate for solder mask thickness
-

IR demo PCB
************************
v0.1 -> v0.2
- separate resistors for red and green
- corrected footprint for LED
- other footprint drawn for edge mount SUB-9 connectors (closer pin spacing)
- reordered test point positions and silkscreen
- added silkscreen showing red/green mark/space
